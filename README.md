How to install
==============

First of all depend on you Distribution/Operation System install Pythons ‘setuptools’. 
In some Linux distribution its name is something like ‘pysetuptools’. 

After that execute commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/shahinism/Negar.git
    $ cd Negar
    $ sudo python setup.py install

For now there is no requirements except Pythons standard library.
